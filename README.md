# StarWars

Hello, everyone and welcome to my Star Wars CLI Gem! Here you will be able to get information on ALL of the Star Wars movies, such as, Realease date, Title of the movie, Director & Producer, Opening Craw and the episode ID!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'star_wars'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install star_wars

## Usage
- Once you have cloned the repo from Github, you will need to access the CLI by using the terminal below. Then type cd star_wars_cli
- The next step would be to run the program. Type ruby bin/run down in the terminal to run this program.
- When you run the program you will be welcomed with a message asking what you would like to do. (As well as a little cheesy Star Wars lingo)
          - From here you can choose, 'list movies' or to 'exit'
          - 'list movies' will then prompt you to choose a movie '1-7'
          - From here you can choose a Star Wars movies, or simply 'exit' the program.
- I hope you enjoyed this program, and now you're all caught up and ready to go see "The Rise of Skywalker"
-
